# Homeward - GGJ 2019
## About
Flock this! We're going home. For most of us, nothing beats the feeling of coming home after being away for a while. For no one is this more true than for the mighty ducks, who along with their cohort undertake death-defying journeys and travel great distances to return to their roosts. Unfortunately for our feathered friends, however, their journey home this time is one wrought with more danger than ever before, with a strong possibility of spontaneously exploding into a cloud of feathers. It's almost certain that none of them will return home alive...
